              <div class="col order-last">
                <p class="stars">★★★★★</p>
                <blockquote>"GatherRound is hands down the best platform for finding fun activities and meeting great
                  people. Whether you’re looking to try something new or just want to connect with others who share your
                  interests, this site makes it effortless.

                  I joined a few groups—one for pickleball and another for a book club—and I was blown away by how
                  welcoming and well-organized everything was. The events are engaging, the people are friendly, and
                  it’s been such a refreshing way to socialize outside of work or usual friend circles.

                  If you’ve ever wanted to expand your social life in a meaningful way, GatherRound is the perfect place
                  to start. Highly recommend for anyone looking to turn fun activities into lasting friendships!"

                <blockquote>"GatherRound has completely transformed the way I meet new people and find fun activities.
                  The platform makes it so easy to discover groups that align with my interests, whether it’s hiking,
                  board games, or even niche hobbies like goat yoga!

                  Joining a group is seamless, and the events are always well-organized and welcoming. The best part?
                  The people! I’ve built genuine friendships with like-minded individuals who I may never have met
                  otherwise. GatherRound isn’t just about events—it’s about community and connection. If you’re looking
                  to expand your social circle in a natural and enjoyable way, this is the perfect place to start!"

                  know where to start, this site made it so easy to find activity groups that matched my interests.
                  Whether it’s a casual basketball game, a book club, or a weekend camping trip, there’s always
                  something fun happening.

                  The community is welcoming, and I’ve never felt out of place at an event. It’s the perfect way to meet
                  people in a relaxed, low-pressure setting while doing something you enjoy. I’ve made lasting
                  friendships through GatherRound, and it’s become my go-to for finding social activities. If you’re
                  looking for a fun and friendly way to connect with others, this is it!"</blockquote>
